    "1. What is python, and why is it popular?\n",
    "Ans.     Python is a high level, interpreted programming language. It is known for it's simplicity and readability. It is designed by Guido Van Rossum           in late 1980's and officially released in 1991. It supportts multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and                 functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "         It's popularity stems from :-\n",
    "         =>  It is easy to use as it contains simple syntaxes and it is beginner-friendly.\n",
    "         =>  It is used in wide range of applications, in Industries such as :-  web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine                       learning, game development, automation and many more.\n",
    "         =>  It has a huge collection of libraries and frameworks, which makes development faster and more efficient.\n",
    "         =>  It runs on various operating systems. like Windows, MacOs and Linux. making it highly portable.                                "

    "2. What is an interpreter in python?\n",
    "Ans.     An interpreter is a program that executes python code line by line, translating it into machine language. It allows the code to run directly            without compilation. This makes python easy to use for scripting and debugging. Interpreter also provides immediate feedback on errorrs during          execution."

    "Ans.     Impliciit type casting is done automatically by python when it converts one data type to another like int to string. Where as, explicit type            casting is manually done by the programmer using functions like int(), float() or str()."

    "Ans.     Elif statement is used after if statement. It is used to give multiple number of conditions/statements in a program. first if statement will            be checked. If it is satisfied it will go to the next statement which is elif. Now, if this elif statement is satisfied it will go to next              statement to check, or else it will block the code there itself and neglets the next statements and executes the program and so on. In this             way elif statement works."
